# Source code structure 
Two parts: 

## Graph Construction 
- HyperGraph -> The graph to be constructed.
  - Nested classes
    - Data -> Information related to a vertex. User-impl. 
          -> Implemented as a node of a linked-list.
      - read  -> Read data in file. User-impl.
      - write -> Write data to file. User-impl.
    - DataContainer -> As a data member in the Data class.
                    -> Stores the interfaces user needs to manipulate the information stored in the corresponding Data object.
    - Vertex -> A vertex in the graph. User-impl.
      - VertexId -> The id associated to the vertex.
      - EdgeSet  -> The edges connected to the vertex.
    - Edge   -> An (hyper) edge in the graph. User-impl.
      - EdgeId          -> The id associated to the edge. 
      - VertexContainer -> The vertices connected by the (hyper) graph.
  - Constructors for the HyperGraph class and for the Vertex and Edge classes.
  - Member function:
    - addVertex() -> You should set the id of the vertex first.
    - addEdge()
    - etc.
  - Member variabls: 
    - VertexIDMap -> id-vertex unordered_map.
    - EdgeSet     -> Edges.
  - etc.


## Graph Optimization
- OptimizableGraph -> The class specifies the optimization problem from the perspective of graph. 
                   -> Derived from HyperGraph. 
                   -> It can be seen as the dual of the hyper graph in the optimization field.
