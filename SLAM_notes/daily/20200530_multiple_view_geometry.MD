# The course 
The lecture introduces the basic concepts of image formation - perspective projection and camera motion. The goal is to reconstruct the three-dimensional world and the camera motion from multiple images. To this end, one determines correspondences between points in various images and respective constraints that allow to compute motion and 3D structure. A particular emphasis of the lecture is on mathematical descriptions of rigid body motion and of perspective projection. For estimating camera motion and 3D geometry we will make use of both spectral methods and methods of nonlinear optimization.
