#### pinhole camera 
A pinhole camera is a simple camera without a lens but with a tiny aperture (the so-called pinhole) – effectively a light-proof box with a small hole in one side. Light from a scene passes through the aperture and projects an inverted image on the opposite side of the box.

### Stability in photography 
Cameras use gyroscope to meter and counteract motion blur to approach stability.
